                <h2>React</h2>
                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This framework makes it painless to create interactive user interfaces. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                changes. You can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component
                logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p> 
                <p>React enables you to create really powerful single-page applications.<sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>In 2018 Angular has been one of the most popular frameworks for building single-page web applications. Many new features have been added and it is gaining popularity.

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is the essential building block for adding dynamic features to your website. The JavaScript language is an implementation of the underlying ECMAScript specification. Learning JavaScript from the ground up is an essential milestone
                    in starting your web development career. For many frameworks on the front-end (Angular, React, Vue.js) and on the back-end side (Node.js) the knowledge of JavaScript is a prerequisite.</p>

                <p>The basics of the JavaScript language are easy to learn. However, as the ECMAScript specification evolves, more and more advanced features are added to the language like asynchronous functions, shared memory, and atomic operations.</p>

                <p>If you’re starting with JavaScript it might be overwhelming to read about all those advanced JS concept. Here you should focus on the basics first and then move on to the more advanced concepts afterwards.<sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>With Python you’re able to cover a wide range of use cases. You can implement command line scripts, GUI application and web applications. Furthermore the Python programming language is currently fueling scientific computing.</p>

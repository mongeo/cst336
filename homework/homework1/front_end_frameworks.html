                <h2>React</h2>
                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. The framework is fully component-based. You can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component
                logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p> 
                <p>React 16 has been released in September 2017. Many more improvements have been added with version 16.3.0
                (new lifecycle and context API), 16.4.0 (pointer events) and 16.6.0 (lazy, memo, etc) in 2018. Also version 2.0 of Create React App has been released and is now supporting Babel 7 and Sass out-of-the-box. </p>
                <p>React enables you to create really
                powerful single-page application. If you haven’t done so before you should definitely add React to your skill-set. If you’re planning to develop more complex web application with React you should also consider to take a look at Redux.
                By using Redux you’ll be able to use central state management in your application which makes data handling across components much more easier.</p>

                <h2>Angular</h2>
                <p>Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and JavaScript / TypeScript. The framework combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.</p> 
                <p>In 2018 Angular has been one of the most popular frameworks for building single-page web applications. For Angular developers it was a very exciting year with new major framework updates (version 6 and version 7). Many new features have been added
                and Angular is gaining more and more traction.</p>

                <p>2018 has been a great year for Vue with an explosion in growth. Vue is extremely easy to learn and especially for smaller-sized projects a perfect choice. The learning curve is extremely steep and you can expect to quickly see great results.</p> 
                <p>From a total of 78k stars on Github Vue has evolved to 120k stars at the end of 2018. More and more companies are adding Vue.js to their stacks and the demand for Vue.js developers is growing constantly.</p>
